Wireshark

1. Overview
Wireshark is the leading open-source network protocol analyzer. It captures and analyzes packets across networks, enabling deep inspection of hundreds of protocols.

Use cases:
- Network troubleshooting & diagnostics  
- Packet analysis during pentesting  
- Monitoring traffic, detecting suspicious behavior  
- Learning network protocols & security analysis  

---

2. Key Features
- Live packet capture  
- Deep protocol dissectors (HTTP, TLS, DNS, etc.)  
- Filtering & display filters  
- Exporting captures (PCAP)  
- Packet inspection, reassembly, analysis  
- Integration with CLI tools (tshark)  
- Statistics, flow graphs, IO graphs

3. Installation

Debian/Ubuntu/Kali
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireshark

Windows / macOS

Installers available at https://www.wireshark.org

---

4. Basic Usage
Start capture on interface (Ethernet or WiFi)

Use display filters, e.g.:
http → show HTTP traffic
tls or ssl → TLS traffic
ip.addr == 192.168.1.5 → filter by IP
Stop capture and save to .pcap for later analysis

---

5. Important Tips & Parameters
Use capture filters vs display filters
Enable/disable promiscuous mode
Use “Follow TCP Stream” for session reconstruction
Export packets or streams for further tools

---

6. Advanced Usage / Use Cases
Analyze intercepted traffic from a test network
Check for sensitive data in plaintext (passwords, tokens)
Detect unusual traffic or anomalies (suspicious DNS, unknown protocols)
Use packet export + external tools for deeper analysis
