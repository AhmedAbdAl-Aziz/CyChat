Aircrack-ng

1. Overview
Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security, primarily focusing on cracking WEP/WPA-PSK keys by capturing packets and performing key-recovery attacks.

Use cases:
- Testing WEP/WPA-PSK wireless networks (with permission)  
- Auditing WiFi security in pentesting engagements  
- Learning wireless security and cracking techniques  

---

2. Key Features
- Packet capture and analysis  
- WPA/WPA2-PSK handshake capture & cracking  
- WEP cracking  
- Replay attacks, deauthentication floods  
- Monitoring mode and packet injection  
- Support for multiple wireless cards / adapters  

---

3. Installation

Kali / Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install aircrack-ng


Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S aircrack-ng
macOS (via Homebrew; may need external wireless adapter)

brew install aircrack-ng
Windows (via Cygwin / WSL) – limited support
Better on Linux.

4. Common Commands & Usage Examples
Put interface into monitor mode:

airmon-ng start wlan0
Capture packets:

airodump-ng wlan0mon
Write handshake & IV capture:

airodump-ng --bssid <BSSID> -c <channel> -w capture wlan0mon
Crack WPA/WPA2-PSK using wordlist:

aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> capture-01.cap
Crack WEP:
aircrack-ng capture-01.cap
